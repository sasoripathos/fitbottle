Fault injection testing is an important methodology for assessing the resilience of distributed systems. However, its performance is often suboptimal. This project aims to find the performance bottlenecks within individual fault injection test executions via case studies.

## Completed cases
- **MongoDB**: completed a case study for MongoDB Replica Set. Code in _mongodb_ folder

Details instructions are in the code folders.

## Other folders
- **docker**: the virtualized Jepsen environment used for case studies.
- **measurements**: holds raw data collected for each case study
- **tools**: holds useful automation tools
